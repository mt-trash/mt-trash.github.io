(This is the first entry under the heading **Depression**)

It had stopped raining. He was walking home with his brother. There was a puddle of water on the sidewalk, shining in the afternoon sunlight, and when he came to it, he slapped his brother on the arm and said, "See, there is money, can't you see? I will make money out of that. That is the biggest thing in the world to make money out of."

In the middle of the night it was raining and thundering again. His wife woke up and found that he was gone. She didn't know where he could be. She got up and lit the lamp and waited an hour or so. At last she heard him on the attic stairs; he came into the room, dripping wet, the water running from his hair, and his nightgown pasted to his flesh. He had been up on top of the house. He said it was very nice on top of the house when it rained and the lightning flashed; he liked it.

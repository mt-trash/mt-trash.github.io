Is this "rock music"? Mostly, but there's something by Archie Shepp near the end as well.

I think I remember seeing an interview with Arvo Pärt where he compares a guitar to a loud motorcycle. Either he remembers someone from his youth getting a bike and then he compares it metaphorically to a guitar OR he remembers someone from his youth getting hold of a guitar and compares it to a motorbike. It might be in that documentary about him. Obviously he doesn't just mean the sound, he's talking about two comparable fragments of popular culture. Anyway that's one of those really simplistic comparisons that only works because the speaker's aura has rubbed off on it a little.

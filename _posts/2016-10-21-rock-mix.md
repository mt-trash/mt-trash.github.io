Is this "rock music"? Mostly... but there's something by Archie Shepp in there too.

I think I remember seeing an interview with Arvo Pärt somewhere in which he compares a guitar to a loud motorcycle. Either he remembers someone from his youth getting a bike and he compares it metaphorically to a guitar OR he remembers someone from his youth getting hold of a guitar and compares it to a motorbike. It might be in that long-ish documentary about him. Obviously he doesn't just mean the sound, he's talking about them as fragments of pop culture. Anyway that's one of those really simplistic comparisons that only works because the speaker's aura has rubbed off on it a little.

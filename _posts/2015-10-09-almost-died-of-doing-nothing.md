A source of anxiety and cognitive dissonance: I've always assumed 'I.Q. tests' aren't taken seriously anymore — on account of all the comprehensive debunkings that are sure to exist — but every few weeks I'll come across people (academics, laity, could be anyone really) treating 'I.Q.' like a reliable yardstick and I'll realise I never sought out and read any of those works I felt certain I could count on to undermine such a shoddy notion of objectively measurable one-dimensional intelligence... In Huey Newton's autobiography there's a few lines about him scoring very low on intelligence tests, and you know from watching him speak and act that this is as good a confutation as any... Then again, what if 'I.Q. tests' do measure something, and measure it accurately — and in fact there's no 'what if' about it — the thing they measure being the level of development of a kind of mechanical thought coupled to an iron will (usually termed 'concentration'), almost a personality type, but more precisely an attitude to the world

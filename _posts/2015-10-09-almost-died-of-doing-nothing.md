title: I almost died of doing nothing

If you 'love life' you are my enemy. If you love the arts, and literature in particular, you are my enemy. You make life difficult for me. It takes discipline to love life and art, and this may come easily to you, but I am undisciplined, and uncultivated, and (what's worse) I regard these shortcomings as honourable.

I almost died of doing nothing: whole months went by without my picking up a book or leaving the house, and through an obscure biological chain reaction this lack of new experiences destroyed my body. It caused me to age more rapidly than usual. Don't underestimate psychosomatic processes.

There are many of us, but we're hard to spot. We live (or 'live') like we're anticipating something. Depression is a condition that overtakes you in the aftermath of an unsettling realisation. No matter the particular content of this anagnorisis it always brings to light the *interminable* nature of your situation, and it's this that throws you. Strangely enough, the feeling that things are now permanently wrong makes you live with one eye always on the future. You hold yourself in reserve. Your metabolism slows down. It's a form of resistance. You are waiting for an impossible upheaval, a world revolution. You are obsessed with your bad circumstances, and this makes it hard to enjoy anything; at the same time, in another part of your brain, your refusal to accept an intolerable and interminable situation turns into a refusal to submit to the normal patterns and practices of life. Anhedonic waiting is a way of bearing witness to how bad things really are. (Don't move, don't look away from the contours and scale of the ongoing disaster, even for an instant.)

If someone dies, you wait for them to return... but that's a trite example. The depressed people I have in mind haven't lost anything, they just don't want to live in the world as it exists currently.

How does depression end? The depressed person (1) stops waiting and learns to live normally, confined to the disappointing present and pragmatic near-future; or (2) becomes ardently political or religious; or (3) dies.

Imagine you have no interests, hobbies, plans, prospects, phobias, neuroses — and through sheer good luck you're not depressed, or anxious, or overworked, and you have some free time, and no obligations or debts — you're extremely bored, almost to the point of madness — in this state it's quite likely you would begin to turn into a writer or an abstract expressionist — however, suppose art is taken out of the equation — what would you do with yourself? How would this hypothetically free and unencumbered person behave? Is this the genesis of the 'sex addict' dreamt up by North American therapists? Take sex out of the equation as well. What remains is an idiot savant whose whole person points like a compass in the direction of a pure, immediate, unalienated life... a revolutionary suicide... a believer, devoted to the principle of *agapē*... an enthusiast, liable to act totally irrationally, who will one day miraculously overthrow the present order and inaugurate something different... our commie jesus... someone possessed by *the theoretical opposite of depression*. But is there an alchemical trick that can turn the depressed person into his messianic opposite?

*If we did not make somebody poor...* We already know that every virtuous person, every ethically irreproachable person, every pure secular soul, can only perform their role thanks to the systematic dispossession taking place all the time, globally. That's the necessary precondition for the virtuous person's virtuous actions; that's the source of the raw materials from which they construct their ethical position. The same is true of refined, cultured, learned people. The sensory and intellectual pleasures afforded by the arts are continually vanishing from the everyday experiences of the majority of humans, but this is a by-product of a process that furnishes a select minority with the leisure time and resources necessary for the appreciation of art and literature. The richness and variety of impressions enjoyed by these suprahuman spectators are bought at the price of the real world's unaesthetic transformation into a giant thresher. 

Aesthetic pleasures are closely bound up with the deliberateness of art and of spectatorship. This is true even for the contingent parts of an artwork: a detail may be unintended, but it is always a side-effect of the original design. No aesthetic experience escapes this rule. A devout atheist looking at a sunset imagines he is impressed by dispassionate, huge, non-volitional physical processes, but on a more fundamental level he is pleased with his own volitional apprehension of the scene. The element of intentionality has just been displaced from an external God to a subjective intellect. There's always a bit of mastery, control, and discernment involved in the act of looking — it's negentropic. But the ultramodern world is now succumbing to tendencies that are a hundred times removed from anything like an interpretable 'intention'. The iron logic of mechanised economic growth has developed to the point where it is no longer governed by any single person or group of people; the drastic changes in the earth's atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems are on the brink of turning exponential. Not only have these tendencies escaped human control, they are resistant to contemplation (except at an extremely abstract level). Their effects will eventually bring about the complete decimation of human art: they will destroy art's conditions of possibility. In the meantime they cannot even be 'looked at'.

This gradual disappearance of art from the world takes place in parallel with a massive increase in art consumption — in fact it is an epiphenomenon of the process that makes possible such a massive increase in art consumption.

If the world's depressed people could only make their disinterest more complete and uncompromising... if they could force themselves to stop waiting and watching... then they would act, in unison, and in a truly deliberate way. They wouldn't do it for the sake of art, or for the sake of a life that approximates the alienated form of an artwork. They would act in pursuit of an immediate life, and because they were bored.

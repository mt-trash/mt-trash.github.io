title: I almost died of doing nothing

*You can't say you're a photographer because you take photographs. You can't say you're alive just because you live.* — Masahisa Fukase

If you 'love life', you are my enemy. If you love the arts, and literature in particular, you are my enemy. You make things difficult for me.

I know this puts me in the wrong. It takes discipline to love life, or to love literature, but I am undisciplined, I am uncultivated, and (what's worse) I aim to make a virtue of these shortcomings.

I almost died of doing nothing: whole months went by without my picking up a book or leaving the house, and through an obscure biological chain reaction this lack of new experiences destroyed my body. It caused me to age more rapidly than usual. Don't underestimate psychosomatic processes.

There are many of us, but we're hard to spot. We live (or 'live') like we're anticipating something. Depression is a condition that overtakes you in the aftermath of a deeply unsettling realisation. No matter the particular content of this anagnorisis it always brings to light the *interminable* nature of your situation. The obvious thing to do then is wait. Your metabolism slows down. It's a form of resistance. You are waiting for an impossible upheaval, a world revolution. The thought process is two-sided: you are obsessed with your bad circumstances, which makes it hard to enjoy anything; at the same time, your refusal to accept an intolerable and interminable situation turns into a reluctance to submit to the normal patterns of life. Anhedonic waiting bears witness to how bad things really are. (Don't move, don't take your eyes off the contours and scale of the ongoing disaster, even for an instant.)

If someone dies, you wait for them to return... but that's a trite example. The depressed people I have in mind haven't lost anything, they just don't want to live in the world as it exists currently.

How does depression end? The depressed person (1) stops waiting and learns to live normally, confined to the disappointing present and pragmatic near-future; or (2) becomes ardently political or religious; or (3) dies.

Imagine you have no interests, hobbies, plans, prospects, phobias, neuroses — and through sheer good luck you're not depressed, or anxious, or overworked, and you have some free time, and no obligations or debts — suppose you're wholly disinvested from things as they are — you're bored almost to the point of madness — of course there's a chance you might turn into a writer or an abstract expressionist, but suppose art is taken out of the equation — what would you do, what does this hypothetically free and unencumbered person do? Is this the genesis of the 'sex addict' dreamt up by North American therapists? Well, OK, take sex out of the equation as well. We are left with an idiot savant whose whole person points like a compass in the direction of a pure, immediate, unalienated life... a revolutionary suicide... a believer, devoted to the principle of *agapē*... an enthusiast, acting totally irrationally, who will nevertheless miraculously overthrow the present order of things and inaugurate a new one... our commie jesus... someone possessed by *the theoretical opposite of depression*. Is there an alchemical trick that can turn the depressed person into his opposite?

*If we did not make somebody poor...* We already know that every virtuous person, every ethically irreproachable person, every pure soul, can only perform their role thanks to the systematic dispossession taking place all the time, everywhere. That's the necessary precondition for the virtuous person's virtuous actions; that's the source of the raw materials from which they construct their ethical position. The same is true of refined, cultured, learned people. The kinds of sensory and intellectual pleasures afforded by the arts are continually vanishing from the everyday experiences of the majority of humans, but this is a by-product of a process that furnishes a select few with the free time and resources to appreciate an ever expanding diversity of narrative and plastic forms. The richness and variety of impressions enjoyed by the art lover are bought at the price of the real world's unaesthetic transformation into a giant thresher. 

Aesthetic pleasures are closely bound up with the art object's original deliberateness, the fact of it being designed by someone. This is true even for the contingent parts of the artwork: a detail may be unintended, but it is always a side-effect of the original design. A devout atheist looking at a sunset is impressed by dispassionate, huge, non-volitional physical processes, but on a more fundamental level he is pleased with his own very volitional apprehension of the scene; this is really just a transposition of earlier generations' awed contemplation of 'God's creation', with the emphasis placed instead on the secular individual's thoughts and perceptions. But the ultramodern world is now succumbing to tendencies that are a hundred times removed from anything like an 'intention'. The iron logic of mechanised economic forces is ungoverned by any single person or group of people; likewise the drastic changes in the earth's atmosphere, oceans, ecosystems. Not only have they escaped human control, these tendencies can't be contemplated by anyone — except at an extremely abstract level. Their effects will eventually bring about the complete decimation of human art: they will destroy art's conditions of possibility. In the meantime they cannot even be 'looked at'.

This gradual disappearance of art from the world takes place in parallel with a massive increase in art consumption — in fact it is an epiphenomenon of the process that makes possible this massive increase in art consumption.

If the world's depressed people could only make their disinterest more complete and uncompromising... if they could just stop waiting and watching... then they would act, in unison, and in a truly intentional manner. They wouldn't do it for the sake of art, however. They would act on behalf of life, and because they were bored.

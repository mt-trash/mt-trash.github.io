Why can't I write?

It’s always difficult to write well, to choose appropriate subjects to write about, and (if you’re a naturally prolific writer) to avoid becoming a literary ‘paintspreader’. The really interesting question is whether it has recently become more difficult to write well, and if so, why this has happened. I can’t seem to write anything anymore (fiction, essays, emails), but I don’t know if this is because of personal circumstances or something structural — i.e. some combination of technological and socioeconomic changes that would really let me off the hook.

The boring truth probably amounts to a partly personal and partly sociological explanation. This kind of synthesis is unsatisfying. When somebody tries to tell you there isn’t a clear distinction between the structurally sociological and the purely personal, aren’t you a little suspicious? Doesn’t it seem as though the personal, individual, volitional part of the equation loses its importance? Wouldn’t you prefer a less equivocal answer? Is there something wrong with me, or am I just a product of my environment? The difference looks like the same one that obtains between ‘guilty’ and ‘not guilty’.

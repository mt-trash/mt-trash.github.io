Why can't I write?

It’s always difficult to write well, to choose appropriate subjects to write about, and (if you’re a naturally prolific writer) to avoid becoming a literary ‘paintspreader’. The really interesting question is whether it has recently become more difficult to write well, and if so, why this has happened. I can’t seem to write anything anymore (fiction, essays, emails), but I don’t know if this is because of personal circumstances or something structural — i.e. some combination of technological and socioeconomic changes that would really let me off the hook.

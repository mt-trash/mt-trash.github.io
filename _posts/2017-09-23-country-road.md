Walking along a country road late at night, a road without street lamps, your eyes adjust to the dark and you begin to notice the countryside's primordial aspect. Silhouetted copses, bits of uncultivated land here and there. At the height of summer the plants and trees are totally unrestrained. Narrower paths are crowded by ferns, huge dock leaves, brambles. In the night the colour drains out of everything, and when the weather's calm it's quiet. Things appear in outline, and you can hear them growing. If the mood is right you may start to think about how this environment would look if it were left uninhabited for a long period of time. You can't help imagining an overgrown jungle teeming with greenery and bereft of anything else. Your mind's eye swoops over and through the trees, sees green, blue, brown, hears the rustle and snap of hypertrophied branches. Maybe you got this idea from the beginning of *Heart of Darkness*.

You're mistaken — you aren't imagining it correctly at all. The eeriness and silence of an overgrown country, its speechlessness, its teeming foliage — this all demands a human spectator, someone lost in the woods and despairing. The disembodied panoramic perspective distorts everything. Forget the aerial view, forget maps. You must try to imagine yourself lost, desperate, and driven mad by survival. There's nothing beautiful about your surroundings. Think of twilight in the boundless forest. All you can see are tree trunks, grasses, insects, adders, fertile mud. After weeks of walking you emerge from the woods and find you're at the coast. It's freezing cold. There's sand, saltwater, waves, and big white clouds. You stumble out of the trees and onto the beach. How would your lost self look after a month of wandering in the forest? Broken? Sweating, shivering, hair matted, incapable of speech, incapable of carrying on an internal monologue. Maybe you're surprised by the sight of the sea and you laugh. A reaction, then, but no reflection.

Leave it alone: forget the apocalyptic fantasy latent in country roads; don't get darkly excited by the hopelessness, the unfeeling trees, nature's sublime-seeming proliferation; ignore the absolutely brutal lifecycles of plants and trees. They don't even flinch when you cut off their limbs. Could you bear to be oppressed by so many of them?

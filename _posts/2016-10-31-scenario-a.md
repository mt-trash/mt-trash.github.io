*"Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt"* â€“ Hamlet

**Marine A** turns a few cartwheels in the middle of the stage. His fatigues and flak jacket rustle heavily. Abruptly he stops and looks around. The footlights are blinding. There doesn't seem to be anyone in the audience.
**Marine B** (sounding a bit hysterical): What are we meant to be doing here?
**Marine A** (gruffly): We're fighting the $10 Taliban, comrade.
**Marine C**: You know there's a variant of chess called 'Horde Chess' in which one side has thirty-two pawns. The other side has a normal set of pieces. It's more or less the same as Dunsany's Chess, which was invented by Lord Dunsany in 1942. Four ranks of eight pawns. Bit of a West Brit, Dunsany, apparently. Fought on the wrong side in 1916. Fought in the Boer War before that. I mention it because the whole 'horde' concept pretty clearly comes out of the colonial imaginary doesn't it...? I mean the last outpost of ordered, hierarchical civilization faced down by an undifferentiated mass...
**Marine A**: No need to labour the point, soldier.
**Marine C**: It doesn't look like you'd be able to play this variant without losing a lot of pieces in quick succession. That's a function of the asymmetry.

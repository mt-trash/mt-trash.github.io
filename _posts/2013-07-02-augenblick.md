They thought we had arrived at a historically unique moment, an instant forgetful of the others that preceded it. The idea hanging over everyone's heads (unnerving to some, encouraging to others) was that we had achieved a disappointing equilibrium. The only catastrophes that seemed likely now were the apolitical ones. In another couple of decades we would probably forget the old possibilities. There was even a popular feeling that two, three millennia's worth of thought and history could be archived and minimised. In fact this was already happening, a semi-natural process gathering pace each academic year, as the students of the humanities, the old paper culture, confined themselves to the old buildings. None of it would be lost â€” but then the world was filling up with happy, good-natured philistines, so who would ever read it again? Some new form of history and culture would surely build itself up in place of the old one, more or less from nothing, situated nowhere in particular, undergirded by technology. Without burning anything down we had begun a slow and apparently egalitarian cultural revolution.

The more circumspect academics continued to compare the new century to the old one, pointing out similarities between the present impasse and the period before the First World War. But for most of us it was easy to imagine that our suspended age could last another thousand years. Not exactly an end of history, and certainly not a repetition of an earlier epoch, but an evergreen, frozen condition... The next social upheaval was to be deferred, day by day, for as long as possible. We would try our best to keep anyone from leaving this moment. Not even our great grandchildren would be able to look back or down on us: they would belong to the same era. They would be our contemporaries.

Now, of course, the situation is completely reversed. Complacence has given way to anxiety.
